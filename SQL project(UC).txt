Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000 rows
ii. Business table = 10,000 rows
iii. Category table = 10,000 rows
iv. Checkin table = 10,000 rows
v. elite_years table = 10,000 rows
vi. friend table = 10,000 rows
vii. hours table = 10,000 rows
viii. photo table = 10,000 rows
ix. review table = 10,000 rows
x. tip table = 10,000 rows
xi. user table = 10,000 rows

 Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category =2643
iv. Attribute =1115
v. Review = 9581(User_id)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo =6493(business_id)
viii. Tip = 537(user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 9415
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:No

6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities:

| .Hon   |         1246 |
| eric   |         1116 |
+--------+--------


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Posting more reviews doesn't necessarily generate to getting more fans because results from the query showed that number of fans each individual have is not dependent on their reviews count. For context, there were individuals who made 1 review yet had over 50 fans and on the flip side, there were individuals with numerous reviews yet have 1 fan
	

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:There are more reviews with the word Love than the word Hate

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT  COUNT(text)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE "%Love%"    


SELECT  COUNT(text)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE "%Hate%"


10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:Amy,Mimi,Harald,Gerald,Christine,Lisa,Cat,William,Fran,Lisa

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT id,name,SUM(fans) AS num_fans
FROM user
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num_fans DESC
LIMIT 10

	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
id                     | name      | num_fans |
+------------------------+-----------+----------+
| -9I98YbNQnLdAmcYfb324Q | Amy       |      503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, they have different number of reviews as businesses with 4-5 star ratings have higher number of reviews than businesses with 2-3 star ratings
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Businesses with higher star ratings especially ones with 4.0 star rating have the highest number of reviews

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT name, stars,category,b.review_count,
CASE
      WHEN stars BETWEEN 2.0 AND 3.5 THEN "Low"
      WHEN stars >=4.0 THEN "High"
ELSE "No category"
END AS "Quality"
FROM business b
JOIN category c
ON b.id=c.business_id
WHERE city="Toronto" AND category="Restaurants"
ORDER BY stars DESC





2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:The opened business have a higher average star rating(3.68) compared to the closed business category(3.52)
         
         
ii. Difference 2:The opened businesses have more reviews than the closed businesses
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT is_open,COUNT(*) AS Numbers,AVG(stars) AS star_avg,SUM(review_count),
CASE
    WHEN is_open=1 THEN "Opened"
    WHEN is_open=0 THEN "Closed"
    ELSE "No business" 
END AS "Availability"
FROM business 
GROUP BY Availability



3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:Analysis around the commonalities in business categories
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
The analysis will require both quantitative and qualitative variables to find answers to the business question my analysis is trying to answer as I want to learn about the quality of services across all the business categories available using their stars and reviews as a metric.
I will need the name of business categories,number of businesses in each category,number of reviews and the average star ratings. I would also need to carryout aggregations to summarize the data in a group for better interpretation

                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
